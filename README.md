My name is Marcos, and I'm from 🇧🇷!

I've been developing software since 2018.

After a couple of years in the backend, I noticed that customers don't want to see if my application has 100% test coverage or how fast I can consume and return data.

So, I've been on a journey to sharpen my frontend skills to ensure I can showcase all my work in a beautiful and seamless way.
